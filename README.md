1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

7. Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

14. Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

20. Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

27. Remove Element
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length
